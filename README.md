# CSS Hover 3D Animation Project

This is a small project that demonstrates a simple 3D hover effect using only HTML and CSS. The project includes an `index.html` file and an `assets` folder containing CSS and image resources.

## Project Structure

````plaintext
.
├── assets/
│   ├── css/
│   │   └── styles.css   # CSS for the 3D hover animation
│   └── images/
│       └── example.jpg  # Image used in the hover effect
└── index.html           # Main HTML file

## Features

- **Pure CSS**: No JavaScript is used in this project.
- **3D Hover Animation**: When the user hovers over the image, it triggers a 3D transformation effect.
- **Responsive Design**: The animation adapts to different screen sizes.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/css-hover-3d-animation.git

3. Open the index.html file in your web browser to see the animation in action:

## Customization
